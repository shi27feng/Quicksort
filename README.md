# Quicksort

This work is using OpenCL description of QuickSort algorithm as a source code for Vivado HLS.

### Introduction to quicksort algorithm:

The quicksort algorithm is developed by Tony Hoare while working in Moscow State University as a vising student, at that time the algorithm was developed during the project of machine translation which was supposed to sort words before looking up to dictionary. His first idea to implement sorting algorithm was insertionsort which was slow and made hime to come up with a new approach taht was Quicksort.


Quicksort gained widespread adoption, appering, for example it became default function library in Unix and C.
